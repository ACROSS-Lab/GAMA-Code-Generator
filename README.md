# GAMA-Code-Generator
------
## Overview 
Meet GAMA-GPT, a text-to-code model specifically engineered to produce high-quality GAML code snippets in response to user input prompts. 

Derived from Mistral-Instruct-v2.0 and fine-tuned for optimal performance, this model boasts a rapid response time, typically returning a question in under 3 seconds. Notably, GAMA-GPT surpasses other widely-known AI tools like ChatGPT, POE, Gemini, BingAI, and StarCoder in the quality of GAML code it generates.

## Purpose
This project **_aims to create a text-to-code model designed specifically for generating GAML language in response to user questions_**. 

------
Inspired by ChatGPT and other prominent AI tools, its objective is to facilitate the generation of code snippets tailored to the GAML language. **_This model strives to enhance the learning experience for newcomers to GAML programming by providing intuitive assistance._** Additionally, for users seeking to utilize GAML for their tasks without delving deeply into programming, this model offers a helpful solution for generating code.

The right Figure above illustrates that when given a consistent prompt input, ChatGPT typically yields subpar responses specifically for the GAML language. Conversely, tools equipped with our fine-tuned for this purpose tend to produce significantly more accurate results.
