make me a model with species named "fish", fish colour will be yellow 1. Create a new species called `fish` in the `models` directory of your project.
2. Define the color of the fish as `#yellow`.
3. In the `init` block, create an instance of the `fish` species and set its location to `{x: 0, y: 0}`.
4. Use the `draw` block to define how the fish is displayed visually. In this case, we'll use a simple circle shape with a radius of 5 pixels. The color of the circle should be determined by the `color` attribute of the fish (which was previously defined as `#yellow`).

Here's what the code might look like:

```kotlin
species fish {
    float size <- 1.0;
    rgb color <- #yellow;
    
    init {
        create fish {
            location <- { x: 0, y: 0 };
        }
    }
    
    draw circle(size) color: color;
}
```

This code creates a `fish` species with a default size of 1.0 and a yellow color. It initializes a single fish at the origin of the world. When drawing the fish, it simply draws a circle with a radius equal to its size and a yellow color. This results in a simple representation of a fish that can be used in simulations or visualizations.
